# Getting Started with Next.js

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) instead of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) because Next.js is a framework built on top of React.js and offers a lot of features that make development easier and faster.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app with nextjs in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
